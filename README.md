# BlockOut
BlockOut for browser
=======

This is a remake of the 3D Tetris "BlockOut". 
I didn't write it, I just made a few modifications. 
The original lives on [Chrome Experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/cubeout/?f=) and was done by [alteredq](https://github.com/alteredq).

My modifications correct the way the pieces rotate. 
Animation can get a little jaggy occasionally, but everything behaves as it should. 
I did not intend to make this perfect but merely playable.
I will try to make it look as much as possible as the original BlockOut from 1989.
